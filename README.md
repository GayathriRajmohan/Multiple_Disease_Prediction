# Multiple_Disease_Prediction
## MultipleDiseasesPrediction
Develop an interactive web application using Streamlit for predicting the likelihood of three prevalent diseases: heart disease, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease, based on relevant medical data and user input.The primary objective is to create a user-friendly interface that allows individuals to input their medical information and receive predictions regarding their risk of developing these diseases. The application should provide accurate predictions based on machine learning models trained on extensive datasets.
